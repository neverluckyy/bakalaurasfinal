Security Awareness Essentials,Phishing and Social Engineering,Introduction,2,"Social engineering is the art of tricking people to bypass security. In this section, you’ll learn what it looks like across email, calls, texts, and in person—and how to respond safely."
Security Awareness Essentials,Phishing and Social Engineering,Key Concepts,5,"- Attack types: phishing (email), vishing (voice), smishing (SMS), pretexting, baiting, and tailgating.
- Human levers: urgency, authority, curiosity, fear, and helpfulness.
- Safe response: don’t click or reply; report and verify via trusted channels."
Security Awareness Essentials,Phishing and Social Engineering,Real-World Examples,8,"**Pair 1 — ""Bgs Security: You Have Messages In Quarantine"" → fake sign-in page**

![Bgs Security Quarantine Email](/phishing-examples/bgs-security-email.png)

**What it's doing**

It pretends to be an internal security/quarantine notification (""messages held in quarantine"" with a Release button) to lure you into clicking a ""Quarantine page"" link, then it takes you to a generic login form to steal credentials.

**Phishing indicators in the email**

Sender doesn't match the organization: ""Bgs IT Department"" is coming from …@atlassbio.com, not an official BGS domain.

External sender warning banner (""originated outside of the organization"") contradicts the claim it's an internal security notice.

Text/formatting errors and weird characters (e.g., ""ori=inated"", ""attach=ents"", ""held -or"", ""r=ceived"", odd copyright like ""©20=4"") are classic mass-phish artifacts.

Creates pressure/action: ""Review within 15 days"" + ""Release"" encourages clicking instead of verifying via the real security portal.

![Bgs Security Fake Login Page](/phishing-examples/bgs-security-website.png)

**Phishing indicators on the website**

Domain is wrong: it's hosted on …pages.dev (a free/static hosting platform) with a random-looking subdomain (enogp3wehr…) — not your company or Microsoft.

Generic credential-harvesting form: just ""Email / Password"" with ""Sign in"", no real corporate SSO flow, no legitimate branding/tenant info.

No normal trust signals: you'd expect a real quarantine workflow inside Microsoft 365 Defender/Quarantine or your company security portal, not a standalone login box.

**Pair 2 — ""Operations Authentication / Office365 password update"" → spoofed Microsoft login on a non-Microsoft domain**

![Office365 Password Update Email](/phishing-examples/office365-email.png)

**What it's doing**

It claims your Office 365 password must be updated ""today"" and pushes you to click Use Active Password. The link leads to a page imitating a Microsoft sign-in choice screen.

**Phishing indicators in the email**

Sender is a consumer email provider: message is from …@gmx.de while pretending to be ""Airexplore Service"" / ""Office365"".

The email asks you to take an account/security action via a link. Real password expiry notices typically direct you to your known internal/password portal, and they don't use odd CTAs like ""Use Active Password"".

Grammar/spacing issues (""due for update today"", extra spaces before punctuation) are common in phishing kits.

External sender banner again conflicts with ""created by your IT department"" style messaging.

![Office365 Fake Microsoft Login](/phishing-examples/office365-website.png)

**Phishing indicators on the website**

Domain mismatch (biggest red flag): the browser shows plast.toys.up-plastic.com/.../oauth2/... — this is not a Microsoft domain (you'd expect login.microsoftonline.com, microsoft.com, etc.).

""Looks like Microsoft"" is not proof: attackers often copy Microsoft pages or simulate OAuth-looking URLs to appear legitimate.

Suspicious URL structure: using Microsoft-like path fragments (e.g., /oauth2/.../authorize) on a random domain is a common trick to fool quick checks.

**Pair 3 — ""Encrypted message / ACH transfer awaiting your review"" (ShareFile pretext) → fake ""Webmail Portal Access"" on r2.dev**

![ShareFile Encrypted Message Email](/phishing-examples/sharefile-email.png)

**What it's doing**

It pretends you received a secure encrypted message about a financial transfer and must click View Your Message, then it tries to capture your email credentials on a fake ""webmail"" login page.

**Phishing indicators in the email**

High-pressure finance lure: ""ACH/EFT transfer received… awaiting your review"" is designed to trigger urgency and curiosity.

""Encrypted message / view message"" pattern is commonly abused because it plausibly requires a login.

Brand mismatch risk: it claims ""Powered by Citrix ShareFile 2024"", but phishers frequently copy that style while hosting the link elsewhere (not on Citrix/ShareFile domains).

External sender banner + unusual ""via"" sender naming can indicate spoofing/relaying.

![Fake Webmail Portal Login](/phishing-examples/sharefile-website.png)

**Phishing indicators on the website**

Hosted on …r2.dev: that's Cloudflare R2 object storage/public hosting, not a real webmail or ShareFile/Microsoft login domain.

Broken template placeholder is a smoking gun: the email field shows %7BRECIPIENT_EMAIL%7D (URL-encoded {RECIPIENT_EMAIL}), meaning this is a sloppy phishing kit that failed to personalize properly.

Generic login box + scary error message: ""That account doesn't exist. Enter a different account"" is often used to force retries and harvest credentials."
Security Awareness Essentials,Phishing and Social Engineering,Summary,2,"- Social engineering targets people—not systems.
- Expect urgency or secrecy; verify independently.
- Report suspicious messages using the official phishing/report button."
Security Awareness Essentials,Passwords and MFA,Introduction,2,"Strong, unique passwords plus multi-factor authentication (MFA) stop most account takeovers. Here’s how to do it right."
Security Awareness Essentials,Passwords and MFA,Key Concepts,5,"- Use long, unique passphrases; store them in a password manager.
- MFA hierarchy: strongest → FIDO2/WebAuthn keys; then authenticator apps; push/SMS are weaker.
- Watch for password reuse, password spraying, and MFA “push” fatigue."
Security Awareness Essentials,Passwords and MFA,Real-World Examples,4,"**Credential stuffing:** Your old forum password unlocks your work email. **Action:** Use unique passwords and enable MFA everywhere.

**Unexpected MFA prompt:** You get a login approval you didn’t start. **Action:** Deny it, change your password, and report.

**Weak policy:** “Change every 30 days” with short passwords. **Action:** Prefer long passphrases; change only on compromise."
Security Awareness Essentials,Passwords and MFA,Summary,2,"- Length + uniqueness beat frequent forced changes.
- FIDO2 keys are most phishing-resistant.
- If a password may be exposed: change it, kill active sessions, enable MFA."
Security Awareness Essentials,Ransomware,Introduction,2,Ransomware locks (and often steals) data to extort payment. Prevention and fast containment are critical.
Security Awareness Essentials,Ransomware,Key Concepts,5,"- Initial access: phishing, exposed RDP/VPN, stolen creds, unpatched systems.
- Defense-in-depth: least privilege, patching, EDR, segmentation, and tested backups (3-2-1 with an offline copy).
- “Double extortion”: attackers both encrypt and exfiltrate data."
Security Awareness Essentials,Ransomware,Real-World Examples,4,"**Malicious attachment:** “Invoice.pdf.exe.” **Action:** Don’t open; report and quarantine.

**Lateral movement:** One compromised laptop spreads across flat networks. **Action:** Segment networks; restrict admin rights.

**Infection discovered:** Files start appending “.locked”. **Action:** Isolate the device, unplug from network, notify IR."
Security Awareness Essentials,Ransomware,Summary,2,"- Backups must be frequent, tested, and at least one offline.
- Speed matters: isolate first, then investigate.
- Paying ransom doesn’t guarantee decryption or deletion."
Security Awareness Essentials,Safe Internet Browsing,Introduction,2,"Browsing safely is about verifying sites, limiting exposure, and keeping software current."
Security Awareness Essentials,Safe Internet Browsing,Key Concepts,5,"- HTTPS = encryption, not endorsement; still verify the domain.
- Reduce risk: updates, ad/tracker blockers, least-privilege browsing (no local admin), sandbox/containers for risky sites.
- Beware drive-by downloads and certificate warnings."
Security Awareness Essentials,Safe Internet Browsing,Real-World Examples,4,"**Certificate warning on a login page:** Stop and use a known good bookmark; don’t click through.

**Free software from a random site:** Use official vendor stores or repos only.

**Public Wi‑Fi:** Use a VPN; avoid logging into sensitive accounts."
Security Awareness Essentials,Safe Internet Browsing,Summary,2,"- Trust the domain, not the padlock alone.
- Keep browsers/plugins patched.
- Use bookmarks for sensitive logins; avoid unknown downloads."
Security Awareness Essentials,Social Media Safety,Introduction,2,Social media is a goldmine for social engineers. Limit what you share and lock down your accounts.
Security Awareness Essentials,Social Media Safety,Key Concepts,5,"- Oversharing fuels pretexts and answers security questions.
- Verify friend/follow requests; impersonation accounts are common.
- Enable MFA; review third-party app permissions."
Security Awareness Essentials,Social Media Safety,Real-World Examples,4,"**Giveaway DMs asking for your login:** Never provide credentials; official promos don’t need passwords.

**Fresh “coworker” account with few posts:** Confirm identity out-of-band before accepting or sharing.

**Screenshots showing internal dashboards:** Redact or avoid posting; check for sensitive data."
Security Awareness Essentials,Social Media Safety,Summary,2,"- Share less; verify more.
- Turn on MFA and prune risky app permissions.
- If compromised: regain access, change password, enable MFA, review sessions."
Phishing Red Flags,Understanding Phishing,Introduction,2,"Phishing tricks you into clicking, downloading, or revealing secrets. Know the variants and the common goals."
Phishing Red Flags,Understanding Phishing,Key Concepts,5,"- Variants: bulk phishing, spear phishing, clone phishing, quishing (QR), and pharming (DNS redirection).
- Goals: steal credentials, deliver malware, or capture sensitive data.
- Best action on suspicion: report via the phishing button—don’t interact."
Phishing Red Flags,Understanding Phishing,Real-World Examples,4,"**Clone phishing:** A real vendor email is re‑sent but links are swapped. **Action:** Compare URLs; contact the vendor via known channels.

**QR code on a parking meter:** Use the official app/site; avoid scanning unknown codes.

**Pharming:** Typing the correct URL still lands on a fake site. **Action:** Check the certificate/URL carefully; report to IT."
Phishing Red Flags,Understanding Phishing,Summary,2,"- Phishing spans many channels beyond email.
- Personalization (spear phishing) increases believability.
- When in doubt, report and verify independently."
Phishing Red Flags,Identifying Suspicious Sender Information,Introduction,2,Attackers spoof names and domains to appear legitimate. Inspect the real sender—not just the display name.
Phishing Red Flags,Identifying Suspicious Sender Information,Key Concepts,5,"- Look‑alike domains, extra words, or accented characters (homographs/Punycode).
- Mismatch between From and Reply‑To; sudden domain changes from vendors.
- Mail from real domains can still be malicious if the mailbox is compromised."
Phishing Red Flags,Identifying Suspicious Sender Information,Real-World Examples,4,"**applé-security.com:** Treat as malicious; report.

**“HR” display name + hr@company-secure-login.net:** External masquerading as internal; verify via official HR channels.

**Vendor switches to “-payments.io” domain:** Call the known contact to confirm any change."
Phishing Red Flags,Identifying Suspicious Sender Information,Summary,2,"- Check the full address and domain; don’t trust display names.
- Out‑of‑band verification is your safety net.
- Compromised real accounts show unusual behavior—stay alert."
Phishing Red Flags,Spotting Urgent or Threatening Language,Introduction,2,Pressure tactics push you to act before thinking. Recognize the emotional levers and slow down.
Phishing Red Flags,Spotting Urgent or Threatening Language,Key Concepts,5,"- Red flags: “final warning,” secrecy requests, countdowns, or threats.
- Finance angle: urgent payment or wire requests are classic BEC signals.
- Use trusted paths (bookmarks/official apps) instead of embedded links."
Phishing Red Flags,Spotting Urgent or Threatening Language,Real-World Examples,4,"**Mailbox over quota:** Email says “login now or deletion.” **Action:** Use your normal portal; report the email.

**Executive secrecy request for a same‑day wire:** Pause and call a known number to verify.

**Gift cards demanded to avoid termination:** Fraud—report immediately."
Phishing Red Flags,Spotting Urgent or Threatening Language,Summary,2,"- Urgency, secrecy, and fear are manipulation tools.
- Legitimate requests still follow policy and approvals.
- Verify before acting—especially for money or credentials."
Phishing Red Flags,Recognising Suspicious Attachments,Introduction,2,Attachments can deliver malware. Know which types are risky and how to handle them.
Phishing Red Flags,Recognising Suspicious Attachments,Key Concepts,5,"- Highest risk: executables, script files (.exe, .js), macro‑enabled docs, password‑protected archives from unknown senders.
- Tricks: double extensions (invoice.pdf.exe), unusual file sizes.
- Safer sharing: read‑only PDFs or secure portals with access controls."
Phishing Red Flags,Recognising Suspicious Attachments,Real-World Examples,4,"**Password‑protected ZIP from an unknown sender:** Don’t open; report—attackers use passwords to evade scanners.

**Macro‑enabled “payment_details.xlsm”:** Don’t enable macros; verify first.

**Shipping notice with attachment:** Check your order in the retailer’s app/site—never open unsolicited attachments."
Phishing Red Flags,Recognising Suspicious Attachments,Summary,2,"- Treat unexpected or executable attachments as hostile.
- Verify the sender and scan/quarantine when needed.
- Prefer safer formats and approved sharing portals."
Phishing Red Flags,Recognising URL Manipulation,Introduction,2,Links often hide deception. Learn to read URLs and preview where they really go.
Phishing Red Flags,Recognising URL Manipulation,Key Concepts,5,"- Verify the registered domain (e.g., example.co.uk); subdomains can mislead.
- Hover to preview; beware mismatched link text vs. destination and shorteners.
- Homograph/Punycode look‑alikes (paypaI.com) can fool the eye."
Phishing Red Flags,Recognising URL Manipulation,Real-World Examples,4,"**company.com.secure-login.io login page:** It’s phishing; the real domain is secure-login.io.

**Shortened link in a bank SMS:** Don’t tap—open your bank app or typed bookmark.

**Query string asking for a password in the URL:** Never; secure sites don’t put credentials in URLs."
Phishing Red Flags,Recognising URL Manipulation,Summary,2,"- Use HTTPS and the correct domain.
- Visit sensitive sites via bookmarks or manually typed URLs.
- If link text ≠ destination, don’t click—report."
